## Inspiration
The inspiration behind Snippmate came from the need to streamline the development process by providing a unified dashboard for all the essential assets and resources that developers frequently use. In our daily work, we often find ourselves searching for code snippets, APIs, and other reference materials across various tabs and websites. Snippmate aims to simplify this process by bringing all these resources together in one place.

## What it does
Snippmate is a Chrome Extension that offers a centralized dashboard where developers can access and manage their frequently used assets. Here's what it does:

Unified Dashboard: Snippmate provides a user-friendly dashboard that consolidates code snippets, APIs, and other reference materials.

Summarized and Optimized Code: Snippmate optimizes code snippets for performance, readability, and best practices. It summarizes lengthy code blocks and provides helpful descriptions.

One-Click Access: With Snippmate, developers can access their code snippets and other assets with a single click, eliminating the need to search through browser tabs and bookmarks.

Customization: Users can organize their assets, create folders, and add labels for easy categorization and retrieval.

## How we built it
Snippmate was built using the following technologies and steps:

Chrome Extension: We started by developing a Chrome Extension to integrate Snippmate seamlessly into the browser.

User Interface: We designed an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the dashboard, making it easy for developers to add, edit, and organize their assets.

Code Optimization: We implemented code optimization algorithms to analyze and improve code snippets automatically. This includes formatting, linting, and summarization.

Backend Services: We set up backend services to support features like code summarization, API integration, and asset storage.

Integration with External APIs: Snippmate connects with external APIs to fetch the latest data and documentation for various technologies.

Customization Options: We added customization options, allowing users to personalize their dashboard and tailor it to their specific needs.

Testing: Rigorous testing was performed to ensure the extension works smoothly and efficiently.

Documentation: We prepared clear and concise documentation to help users get started with Snippmate.
